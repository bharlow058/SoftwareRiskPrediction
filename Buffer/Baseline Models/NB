  The new system will provide a report that clearly shows what courses the student have completed and what courses they still need to take.                                                                              1.0     1.0     2.0     1.0     1.0
  This 0.9ity will be important in saving students time from looking at the whole timetable of their course                                                                                                              1.0     1.0     2.0     1.0     1.0
  The new system will be accessible in any computer that is connected to the internet                                                                                                                                    1.0     2.0     1.0     1.0     1.0
  The new system will have an 0.25 that is very easy to use and does not require training to use.                                                                                                                        1.0     1.0     1.0     1.0     2.0
   It should combine some of the features of the old system so that users (students) who are familiar with the old system will not have trouble adjusting to the new system                                              1.0     1.0     1.0     2.0     1.0
  The new system should also have an 0.25 that can be useful to records employees for them to easily process transcript requests.                                                                                        1.0     1.0     2.0     1.0     1.0

  The new system should have a tool to help students produce their timetable instead of them spending much time looking at the timetable and manually planning it                                                        1.0     1.0     1.0     2.0     1.0
  This 0.9ity does not replace the old system of planning the timetable manually but it is an additional feature that can be used                                                                                        1.0     1.0     1.0     1.0     2.0
  In the event of a system crash during a transaction, the current transaction will either completed or not completed. This will be handled by an already existing database                                              1.0     2.0     1.0     1.0     1.0
  The system must effectively recover from a crash within five seconds.  For the system to effectively recover, it must be able to restart a sessions with the user within the time limit                                1.0     1.0     2.0     1.0     1.0
